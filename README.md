# Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: January 13, 2026*

Welcome to Madafaker ("we," "us," "our," or the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience when using our mobile application. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our App.

> **By using Madafaker, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.**

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Information You Provide

- **Account Information:** When you create an account, we collect your Google account information (name, email address, profile picture) through Google Sign-In authentication.
- **Nickname:** You choose a unique nickname that is visible to other users.
- **User-Generated Content:** Messages, replies, and ratings you create within the App.
- **Feedback:** Any feedback, ratings, or comments you voluntarily submit to us.

### 1.2 Automatically Collected Information

- **Device Information:** Device type, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information.
- **Usage Data:** Information about how you interact with the App, including:
  - App open/close events
  - Message sends, receives, and reads
  - Notification interactions (opened, dismissed, ignored)
  - Rating and reply activities
  - Mode toggle usage (Shine/Shadow)
  - Session duration and frequency
- **Push Notification Token:** Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) registration token for delivering push notifications.
- **Analytics Data:** We use Firebase Analytics to collect anonymized usage statistics to improve the App experience.
- **Crash Reports:** Firebase Crashlytics automatically collects crash and error data to help us identify and fix issues.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for the following purposes:

- **Provide and Maintain the Service:** To create and manage your account, deliver messages, and enable core App functionality.
- **User Experience:** To personalize your experience and adapt notification frequency based on your engagement patterns.
- **Push Notifications:** To send you notifications when you receive messages or replies (with your permission).

## 3. Content Filtering and Moderation

Madafaker offers two distinct content filtering modes:

- **Shine Mode:** Messages are filtered using OpenAI's Moderation API and Firebase ML Kit to remove abuse, hate speech, harassment, profanity, and other harmful content to maintain a positive environment.
- **Shadow Mode:** Light filtering that only removes illegal content (drug trafficking, exploitation of minors, explicit violence) while allowing more controversial expression.

Message content may be processed by these third-party moderation services to enforce our content policies. No moderation service is perfect, and we reserve the right to manually review flagged content when necessary.

The following information is visible to other users of the App:

- Your chosen nickname

These service providers are contractually obligated to protect your information and use it only for the purposes we specify.

We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., court orders, subpoenas, or government requests).

### 4.4 Business Transfers

If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will provide notice before your information becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
